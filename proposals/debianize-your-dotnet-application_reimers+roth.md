# Debianize Your .NET Application

* Speakers  : *Jacob Reimers, André Roth*
* Available : *10-12 July*
* Length    : *60 minutes*

## Description

At Roche Diagnostics we have reworked our reference architecture from the Microsoft WCF and EntityFramework based approach to an event driven design based on the principles of DDD. This has allowed us to drop the dependency on Microsoft frameworks and base our applications on open source components with GNU/Linux as the OS for all the instrument software. This talk will go through how Linux, open source and .NET are no longer contradictions but can be combined to leverage their individual strengths to create robust and secure applications in a regulated environment.

We will show how we apply standard tools within the Debian/GNU Linux distribution to C#/.NET code so that applications and system services can be seamlessly built, tested, packaged and deployed. Getting the best of both worlds...
